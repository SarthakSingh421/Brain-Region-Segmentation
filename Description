Data Prepration 
  The code uses Shutil library for copying and moving files extracted through 7 zip
  For each item that is a subfolder (identified using os.path.isdir()), it proceeds to find CTA image and mask files.
  The code looks for files within each subfolder.
  If a file has the '.nii.gz' extension and contains 'ROI' in its name, it's identified as a mask file. Otherwise, it's identified as a CTA image file
  Results are saved separately as brain mask and cta image.


Preprocessing

  For each CTA/Brain Mask image in NIfTI format (ending with '.nii.gz'),  the image is loaded using nib.load() and extracts the image data using .get_fdata().

  Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP):

  The code calculates the Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) along the z-axis (axis=2) of the CTA image data using np.max(cta_data, axis=2).
  Normalization and Conversion:

  The MIP data is normalized to the range [0, 255] using cv2.normalize().
  It's then converted to an 8-bit unsigned integer image (CV_8U) using cv2.CV_8U.
